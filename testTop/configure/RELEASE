# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE this file or any file it includes you must
# subsequently do a "gnumake rebuild" in the application's
# top level directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should also do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# Attention developers: Do not edit the locations in this file!
#
# Create a file RELEASE.local pointing to your EPICS_BASE
# build directory, e.g.
#   EPICS_BASE = /home/install/epics/base

# If these tests are built in a directory under CA Gateway,
# use the following definitions:

-include $(TOP)/../configure/RELEASE
-include $(TOP)/../../RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/../configure/RELEASE.local

# If you copied these tests from CA Gateway to be built as a
# standalone TOP, define
#   GATEWAY = /path/to/Gateway
# in the appropriate RELEASE[.local],
# and use the following definitions instead:

#-include $(GATEWAY)/configure/RELEASE
#-include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.local
#-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local
