Description: EPICS PV Gateway
 The EPICS PV Gateway is both a Channel Access server and Channel Access client,
 providing a means for many clients to access a PV while using only one
 connection to the server that owns the process variable.
 .
 It protects critical servers while providing possibly restricted access to
 published process variables. The Gateway typically runs on a machine with
 multiple network interfaces, and its clients and the server may be on
 different subnets.
